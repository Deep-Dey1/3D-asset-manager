# 🔧 Railway Deployment Fix: Persistent File Storage

## Problem Solved ✅

**Issue**: After restarting/redeploying on Railway, uploaded 3D models were not previewable or downloadable even though database records remained intact.

**Root Cause**: Files were stored in ephemeral local directories that get wiped on each Railway deployment.

## Solution Implemented 🚀

### 1. Railway Volume Configuration (`railway.toml`)
```toml
[[volumes]]
name = "model-uploads"
mountPath = "/app/uploads" 
size = "5GB"
```

### 2. Environment-Aware Upload Path (`config.py`)
```python
# Production: Use Railway Volume mount point
if os.environ.get('RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT'):
    UPLOAD_FOLDER = os.environ.get('UPLOAD_PATH', '/app/uploads')
else:
    # Development: Use local uploads folder  
    UPLOAD_FOLDER = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)), 'uploads')
```

### 3. Enhanced Error Reporting (`api.py`)
- Better debugging for missing files
- Clear error messages about deployment-related file loss
- Improved upload folder creation and verification

### 4. File Migration Tool (`check_files.py`)
```bash
# Check file status
python check_files.py

# Clean up missing file entries
python check_files.py --clean
```

## Deployment Steps 📋

### For Railway Dashboard:

1. **Add Environment Variables**:
   ```
   RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT = production
   UPLOAD_PATH = /app/uploads
   ```

2. **Create Volume**:
   - Go to your Railway service
   - Navigate to "Variables" tab  
   - Add Volume mount:
     - **Mount Path**: `/app/uploads`
     - **Size**: 5GB (adjust as needed)

3. **Redeploy**:
   - Push your changes with the new `railway.toml`
   - Railway will automatically set up the volume

### Verification ✔️

After deployment:
1. Upload a new 3D model
2. Restart/redeploy the service
3. Verify the model is still downloadable and previewable

## What This Fixes 🎯

- ✅ **Database records persist** (PostgreSQL)
- ✅ **Uploaded files persist** (Railway Volume)
- ✅ **Models remain downloadable** after restarts
- ✅ **3D previews work** after deployments
- ✅ **No more "File not found"** errors

## File Storage Architecture

```
📁 Railway Container
├── 🗄️ PostgreSQL Database (persistent)
│   └── Model metadata, user data
└── 💾 Volume Mount: /app/uploads (persistent)
    └── Actual 3D model files (.glb, .obj, etc.)
```

The volume mount ensures that even when Railway recreates the container, the uploaded files persist at `/app/uploads`.

## Monitoring & Debugging 🔍

Use the provided diagnostic script to check file storage status:

```bash
python check_files.py
```

This will show:
- Upload folder location
- Files present vs missing
- Database vs filesystem consistency
- Suggestions for fixes

## Alternative Solutions (Future)

If Railway Volumes have limitations, the codebase is prepared for cloud storage migration:
- Cloudinary integration ready (`storage.py`)
- AWS S3 support framework
- Easy provider switching

The persistent storage issue is now resolved! 🎉
