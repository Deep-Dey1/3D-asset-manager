# 🚀 Railway Deployment - Quick Fix Guide

## 📋 **Current Issues Identified:**

1. ❌ **Wrong startup file**: `app.py` → Should be `wsgi.py`
2. ✅ **Volume mounting**: Working correctly
3. ❓ **Project structure**: Need to verify file locations

## 🔧 **Railway Setup Steps:**

### **Step 1: Volume Storage (Main Project)**
In your **Flask app service** (NOT PostgreSQL):
1. Go to **Settings** → **Volumes**
2. Click **"+ Add Volume"**
3. Configure:
   ```
   Name: 3d-assets-storage
   Mount Path: /app/data
   Size: 5GB
   ```

### **Step 2: Environment Variables** 
In **Variables** tab:
```
UPLOAD_PATH=/app/data/uploads
SECRET_KEY=your-production-secret-key
RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT=production
```

### **Step 3: Fix Startup Command**
The `railway.toml` now uses the correct file:
```toml
startCommand = "python wsgi.py"
```

### **Step 4: Alternative Deployment**
If `railway.toml` doesn't work, try:

1. **Delete `railway.toml`** temporarily
2. **Use Procfile instead**:
   ```
   web: python wsgi.py
   ```

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting the Error:**

The error `python: can't open file '/app/app.py'` means:
- Railway was looking for `app.py` (which doesn't exist)
- Should look for `wsgi.py` (which does exist)

### **Current Fix Applied:**
- ✅ Updated `railway.toml` to use `wsgi.py`
- ✅ Volume configuration is correct
- ✅ Environment variables set

## 📁 **Volume Location - IMPORTANT:**

```
✅ CORRECT: Add volume to Flask app service
❌ WRONG: Don't add volume to PostgreSQL service

Your project structure:
├── 🐘 PostgreSQL Service (database only)
└── 🐍 Flask App Service (add volume here)
    └── 📁 Volume: /app/data/uploads
```

## 🎯 **Next Steps:**

1. **Redeploy** - Push changes to trigger new deployment
2. **Check logs** - Verify volume mounting and startup
3. **Test upload** - Upload a model and check persistence

The volume is correctly configured and should work once the startup issue is fixed! 🚀
